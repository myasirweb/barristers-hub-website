                [2021] EWCA Civ 346 - Court of Appeal sets aside decision of
                Upper Tribunal Judge. The Court considered whether procedural
                fairness requires applicant to be provided an opportunity to
                respond to allegation of dishonesty in an entry clearance
                application. Carr LJ commented at [32] that: 'this is an
                important point which does not appear to have been considered
                directly in any of the authorities to date'. Permission was
                granted and the matter was remitted back to the Upper Tribunal
                to provide detailed guidance on this novel argument.</span
